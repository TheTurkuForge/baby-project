# Getting Started
Our dev environment can be used in two ways
### Docker:
```shell
docker-compise up -d
```
When running through docker the container automaticly detects changes under your classpath, rebuilds the code and restarts 
the servlet container. The container outputs two logs `spring-build.log` and `spring-run.log` it's recommended to to run
`tail -f` on both of them because they have information about what going on i.e. `spring-build.log` will tell you why your
code is not compiling. `spring-run.log` will tell you why your requests are not working as expected.

### Local Installation:
Because we are using Spring Boot you can just follow its really simple to install everything.
1. Install Java 15
    1. Pro Tip: To manage multiple versions of Java, you can use Jenv.
1. Run ./gradlew bootRun
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the application running
